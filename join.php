                        <p>New singers can join the chorus at the beginning of both the fall and spring concert seasons (September and January). Singers can come to any or all of the first three rehearsals before committing.  If you are interested, please email us at westlinnchorus@gmail.com.  We will notify you of dates, times, fees and other details.</p>

            <p>When do we rehearse?</p>
            <p>We meet each Thursday at 7:00 pm at Emmanuel Presbyterian Church in West Linn. There are a handful of additional evening or weekend rehearsals each season. We ask that members plan to attend all rehearsals and notify their section leader if they need to be absent.</p>

                        <p>As a true community chorus, we welcome anyone who can carry a tune. No auditions are required. While most members have prior choral singing experience and many read music, others pick up their parts with the help of rehearsals, sectional rehearsals, and practice CDs. Although we meet in West Linn, our members gather from all over the Portland metro area.</p>
