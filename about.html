                    <p>The full chorus performs two concerts in December and May. Two smaller groups of chorus members, the Ensemble and the Barbershop Quartet, also perform at local events and retirement homes. Concerts feature a variety of music. The chorus emphasizes four-part harmony in musical styles that are fun to sing and hear – show tunes, folk songs, classical, jazz, pop, Americana, and more.</p>
